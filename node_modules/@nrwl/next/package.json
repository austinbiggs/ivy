It provides:\n\n\n- Scaffolding for creating, building, serving, linting, and testing Next.js applications.\n\n- Integration with building, serving, and exporting a Next.js application.\n\n- Integration with React libraries within the workspace. \n\nWhen using Next.js in Nx, you get the out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, Cypress, and Jest.
